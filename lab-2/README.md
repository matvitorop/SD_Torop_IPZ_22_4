## Author: Torop Matvii, IPZ-22-4

- This lab was maded to use patterns of programming, that can improve understanding of clean and understandable code for all programmers.
- All patterns was separated on their own libary of classes and folders 
- So `patterns of programming`, with which I worked:
  - [x] **Factory method**
  - [x] **Abstract factory**
  - [x] **Singleton**
  - [x] **Prototype**
  - [x] **Builder**
