# Software design Lab â„–4 
## Author: Torop Matvii, IPZ-22-4

- This lab was maded to use behavioral patterns of programming, that can make a code more readable and cleaner
- All patterns was separated on their own libary of classes
- So `patterns of programming`, with which I worked:
  - [x] **Chain of Responsibility**
  - [x] **Mediator**
  - [x] **Observer**
  - [x] **Strategy**
  - [x] **Memento**
### Chain of Responsibility
The main idea of this pattern is to `forward the problem to another class if the current one cannot solve it`. At first, I made [base interface](./CoR/IHandler.cs) and [base abstract handler](./CoR/BaseHandler.cs).
If handler containing next handler, and haven`t any solution, it starts own next handler. If it hadn't any next handlers, it prints default response. [Every handler had it's own logic](./CoR/HandlerLvl1.cs). 
### Mediator
This pattern was realized in another project as pull request. Main idea of this pattern - to decrease connection between different classes by creating another class that can communicating both of them and sending events between them. In that project system of aicrafts and runways was constructed badly. With help Mediator pattern, I made `Command centre` that containing runways, and can talk to them, if aicraft is landing. Aircrafts and runways containing this command centre to send information and communication with each other (mostly it doing aircaft because runways must only show that they are busy or not). 
### Observer
Idea of this pattern - make a two-way communication between objects. For example, I made base interface [IEventListener](./Observer/IEventListener.cs) that holding method that will keeping logic of future events. Then, I made [ClickEventListener](./Observer/ClickEventListener.cs) and [MouseOverEventListener](./Observer/MouseOverEventListener.cs) that keeping some logic, and I added `list of events` to [html element](./Observer/LightElementNode.cs), that can invoking logic of some events by method [TriggerEvent](./Observer/LightElementNode.cs#L85-91). What we need is to subscribe some events to `html elements` and invoking method at the right moment. 
### Strategy
Very simple pattern, where `context class` choosing from wich `strategy class` using businnes logic. In my realization, I made general interface [IImageLoading](./Strategy/IImageLoading.cs) whic has method `Load`, then I made 2 classes that implementing this class with their own logic. For example, class [InetImageLoad](./Strategy/InetImageLoad.cs), that must download image from the internet. After this, in program, with of some algorithms, program is [choosing wich of logic it will use](./patterns_test/Program.cs#L35-L44). This pattern is similar to `Bridge`, due to both of them can changing their logic by changing class with this logic.  
### Memento
The main principle of this pattern - to save changeable information for backups, without showing the realization. In my case, I made [mini text editor](./Momento/TextEditor.cs) that keeping [class with text](./Momento/TextDocument.cs) and list of [snapshots](./Momento/TextDocumentMemento.cs). Editor can change text, adding text, saving and restoring snapshots of keeping `class with text` by calling methods from this class. At this moment, `class with text` can `creating snapshots of himself` and returning them. Also it can restoring itself with [restore method](./Momento/TextDocument.cs#L30-L41). Why this method has data type verification. It's because `access should be restricted for editor`, that saving them as parent type `ITextMemento`, due to [GetState method](./Momento/TextDocumentMemento.cs#L19-L22), that showing some important information. It is also worth clarifying that for text using classes due to future versions can containing more fields that also can be changeable.
